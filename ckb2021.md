# Updating for Compatibility With CKB2021

PW-Core has been updated for compatibility with the CKB2021 hard fork. Most notably, PW-Core now supports the CKB2021 address format and Omni Lock.

The CKB2021 address format is a new address scheme that updates the way addresses are encoded in a way that is far more futureproof. All old addresses, including both short addresses and long addresses, are now deprecated in favor of the new addresses. The old addresses will continue to work for the foreseeable future, but it is recommended that the new addresses are used going forward.

Omni Lock is a new lock script that supports all of the functionality of the original PW-Lock created by Lay2. However, Omni Lock is fully supported by the Nervos Foundation, and also incorporates powerful new features which are well beyond the scope of the original PW-Lock. It is recommended that all users be migrated from PW-Lock to Omni Lock. This means guiding the user through a migration process from the old PW-Lock address to a new Omni Lock address.

## CKB2021 Address Format

PW-Core will read addresses in both CKB2021 (new format) and Pre2021 (old format). No changes need to be made in order to read CKB2021 addresses.

```typescript
// Example of creating an Address instance with a CKB2021 address.
const address = new Address('ckt1qzda0cr08m85hc8jlnfp3zer7xulejywt49kt2rr0vthywaa50xwsqdr2z2v7uxcmthzysxqejkanv72w2rx6uq8s7h4s', AddressType.ckb);
```

When outputting a CKB address using `toCKBAddress()`, a parameter can be passed to specify the version. By default, the newest address format will always be used. Currently, the newest version is CKB2021. 

```typescript
// Example of outputting a CKB address in different versions.

// Create an Address instance with a ETH address.
const address = new Address('0x7aaff596c5e5e788effa0be946014b794cdd8d51', AddressType.eth);

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress());

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.latest));

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.ckb2021));

// ckt1q3uljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqt64l6ed309u7ywl7sta9rqzjmefnwc65gqr9hrgd (Omni Lock; ETH; Pre2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.pre2021));
```

## Omni Lock

PW-Core will read addresses using both Omni Lock (new) and PW-Lock (old). No changes are needed to read Omni Lock addresses. 

```typescript
// Example of creating an Address instance with an Omni Lock and PW-Lock address.
const omniLockAddress = new Address('ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp66fgyfnljgqhs4wjvfrq6qfy3k5huljpqqf3hfdz', AddressType.ckb);
const pwLockAddress = new Address('ckt1qpvvtay34wndv9nckl8hah6fzzcltcqwcrx79apwp2a5lkd07fdxxqwkj2pzvlujq9u9t5nzgcxszfyd49l8usghcwxk4', AddressType.ckb);
```

When outputting a CKB address using `toCKBAddress()`, a parameter can be passed to specify the lock type. By default, Omni Lock will be used. 

Note: Specifying the lock type is not possible with the CKB address type. It can only be done using address types such as ETH.

```typescript
// Example of outputting a CKB address using different lock types.

// Create an Address instance with a ETH address.
const address = new Address('0x7aaff596c5e5e788effa0be946014b794cdd8d51', AddressType.eth);

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress());

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(undefined, LockType.omni));

// ckt1qpvvtay34wndv9nckl8hah6fzzcltcqwcrx79apwp2a5lkd07fdxxqt64l6ed309u7ywl7sta9rqzjmefnwc65gnazqe7 (PW-Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(undefined, LockType.pw));
```

## Addresses Compatibility

By default, the new CKB2021 address format will be used with the new Omni Lock. However, existing dapps may need to generate the previous addresses to allow users to migrate properly. In order to properly support both, it is important to understand how these two parameters affect users.

When these parameters are used together, there are a total of four possible combinations:

1. Omni Lock / CKB2021 (new default)
2. PW-Lock / CKB2021
3. Omni Lock / Pre2021
4. PW-Lock / Pre2021 (previous default)

There are four different addresses, but the combinations have different effects. When changing the address version, it is a change to the off-chain encoding of the human readable format. This means that the on-chain lock script does not change, and assets do not need to be migrated. For example, 1 and 3 both use Omni Lock. If you send assets to an address using combo 1, all the same assets will also be on combo 3 because they are the same lock. The same is true with 2 and 4 because they share the same underlying lock.

Generating all four addresses is possible but only two combinations are the most important. Combo 4 was previously the only one possible, and now only combo 1 is only one recommended.

```typescript
// How to generate all four different address combinations.

// Create an Address instance with a ETH address.
const address = new Address('0x7aaff596c5e5e788effa0be946014b794cdd8d51', AddressType.eth);

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress());

// ckt1qpuljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqgp02hlt9k9uhnc3ml6p055vq2t09xdmr23qqx8wz0x (Omni Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.ckb2021, LockType.omni));

// ckt1qpvvtay34wndv9nckl8hah6fzzcltcqwcrx79apwp2a5lkd07fdxxqt64l6ed309u7ywl7sta9rqzjmefnwc65gnazqe7 (PW-Lock; ETH; CKB2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.ckb2021, LockType.pw));

// ckt1q3uljza4azfdsrwjzdpea6442yfqadqhv7yzfu5zknlmtusm45hpuqt64l6ed309u7ywl7sta9rqzjmefnwc65gqr9hrgd (Omni Lock; ETH; Pre2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.pre2021, LockType.omni));

// ckt1q3vvtay34wndv9nckl8hah6fzzcltcqwcrx79apwp2a5lkd07fdxx7407ktvte083rhl5zlfgcq5k72vmkx4zl2ye54 (PW-Lock; ETH; Pre2021)
console.log(address.toCKBAddress(NervosAddressVersion.pre2021, LockType.pw));
```

## WitnessArgs Changes

Some of the named definitions for WitnessArgs have been changed to better reflect the current offerings.

- `Builder.WITNESS_ARGS.Secp256k1` is used for the default lock and PW-Lock on the mainnet.
- `Builder.WITNESS_ARGS.Secp256k1Pw` is used for PW-Lock on the testnet.
- `Builder.WITNESS_ARGS.Secp256k1Omni` is used for Omni Lock on the testnet and mainnet.

A convinience method called `calculateWitnessArgs()` has been added to the `Builder` class to assist with this. The WitnessArgs required can change depending on which lock is used. This method will automatically select the correct one based on the lock script provided to it.

```typescript
// This method is called from within a class that extends Builder.
this.calculateWitnessArgs(PWCore.provider.address.toLockScript());
```

If you are using custom builders, you may need to make this modification. If you are relying on the built-in builders this change is already reflected.

## CellDeps Changes

When Omni Lock is used, a new Cell Dep may required. This is usually done from within a custom builder.

```typescript
cellDeps.push(PWCore.config.omniLock.cellDep);
```

If you are using custom builders, you may need to make this modification. If you are relying on the built-in builders this change is already reflected.
